# API Fixes Summary - Role-Based Data Filtering

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Analysis History Endpoint
**Problem**: The `/skin-lesions/history` endpoint was returning placeholder data and not implementing role-based filtering.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Updated the endpoint to return actual data from the database
- ✅ Implemented role-based filtering:
  - **Patients**: Only see their own analysis history
  - **Cadres**: See all analysis history (community-wide)
  - **Doctors/Admin**: See all analysis history

**File Updated**: `/backend/app/routers/skin_lesions.py`

### 2. Community Stats Endpoint
**Problem**: Stats were not properly aggregated for different user roles, especially cadres needing community-wide stats.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated community stats endpoint with proper role-based aggregation:
  - **Patients**: Only their own statistics
  - **Cadres**: Community-wide statistics (all users)
    - Total pending reviews from all users
    - Total urgent cases from all users  
    - Total patients in system
    - Total consultations needed
  - **Doctors/Admin**: Full system statistics

**File Updated**: `/backend/app/routers/community.py`

### 3. Frontend Service Updates
**Problem**: Frontend service wasn't handling the correct response format from the new history endpoint.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated `AIAnalysisService.getAnalysisHistory()` to handle the new response format
- ✅ Updated patient dashboard to fetch skin assessment stats from community endpoint
- ✅ Updated cadre dashboard interface to use correct field names

**Files Updated**: 
- `/frontend/src/services/AIAnalysisService.ts`
- `/frontend/src/components/dashboards/PatientDashboard.tsx`
- `/frontend/src/components/dashboards/CadreDashboard.tsx`

## Key Changes

### Backend API Response Format
```json
// GET /skin-lesions/history
{
  "analyses": [/* Array of analysis results */],
  "total_count": 10
}

// GET /community/stats (for cadres)
{
  "totalPendingReviews": 8,
  "urgentCases": 3,
  "completedReviews": 25, 
  "totalPatients": 156,
  "aiAnalysesToday": 12,
  "consultationsNeeded": 3
}

// GET /community/stats (for patients)
{
  "totalSkinAssessments": 3,
  "pendingReviews": 1,
  "completedReviews": 2,
  "urgentCases": 0,
  "lastAssessment": "2025-07-07T09:47:41.990Z"
}
```

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Patients**: Can only access their own data
- **Cadres**: Can access community-wide statistics and all user histories for healthcare oversight
- **Doctors/Admin**: Can access all data in the system

## Impact
- ✅ Patients now see only their own analysis history
- ✅ Cadres see community-wide statistics for proper health monitoring
- ✅ Dashboard numbers reflect actual role-appropriate data
- ✅ Proper aggregation of urgent cases, consultations needed, and patient counts

## Testing
To test the changes:

1. **Patient Role**: Log in as a patient and verify AI analysis history shows only their records
2. **Cadre Role**: Log in as a cadre and verify dashboard shows community-wide statistics  
3. **Cross-Role Verification**: Ensure cadre urgent case count reflects total from all users, not just individual patients

## Next Steps
- Consider adding caching for community-wide statistics to improve performance
- Add pagination for analysis history when the dataset grows larger
- Implement real-time updates for cadre dashboard statistics
