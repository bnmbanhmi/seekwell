*   **`develop`**: ✅ **Now available** - Integration branch for all new development
*   **Existing feature branches**: Currently based on `main` (transition guidance below)

### Workflow Guidelines

#### For New Features (Going Forward)
1. Create feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Develop and commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add patient dashboard functionality"
   ```

3. Push feature branch and create Pull Request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. After code review and approval, merge into `develop`
5. Delete feature branch after merge

#### For Existing Feature Branches (Transition Period)
Since your current feature branches (`feature/IChatbotService`, `feature/forgot_reset_password`, `feature/uc3_chatbot`) are based on `main`:

1. **Continue development normally** on these branches
2. **When ready to merge**, merge them into `develop` instead of `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/your-existing-branch
   git push origin develop
   ```
3. **Delete the feature branch** after successful merge

#### For Bug Fixes
1. Create bugfix branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b bugfix/fix-description
   ```

2. Fix the bug and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: resolve patient data validation issue"
   ```

3. Follow same PR process as features

#### For Critical Hotfixes
1. Create hotfix branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/v1.0.1
   ```

2. Fix the issue and update version:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "hotfix: fix critical security vulnerability"
   ```

3. Merge into both `main` and `develop`:
   ```bash
   # Merge into main
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/v1.0.1
   git tag v1.0.1
   
   # Merge into develop
   git checkout develop
   git merge hotfix/v1.0.1
   ```

### Commit Message Conventions

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:
*   `backend/`: Contains the FastAPI application, including API routers, database models, schemas, CRUD operations, and business logic.
*   `frontend/`: Contains the React-based user interface.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11 or higher
*   Node.js and npm (latest LTS version recommended)
*   PostgreSQL server installed and running
**.env** setup: DATABASE_URL = postgresql://postgres:password@34.67.156.97:5432/clinic-management-v2
### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bnmbanhmi/clinic-management
    cd clinic-management
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory and create/activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    (Ensure `requirements.txt` is in the project root directory)
    ```bash
    pip install -r ../requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory (alongside `app/`) with the following content. Adjust values as per your local setup.
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your_db_user:your_db_password@your_db_host:your_db_port/your_db_name"
    SECRET_KEY="your_very_strong_and_secret_key_here"
    ALGORITHM="HS256"
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
    # Optional: For OpenAI chat functionality, if used
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    ```
    Replace `your_db_user`, `your_db_password`, `your_db_host`, `your_db_port`, and `your_db_name` with your actual PostgreSQL connection details.

5.  **Initialize the Database and Create Initial Admin User**:
    Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and the database specified in `DATABASE_URL` exists.
    From the `backend/` directory, run the script:
    ```bash
    python app/create_initial_admin.py
    ```
    This script will create the necessary database tables and an initial admin user with credentials:
    *   Email: `admin@example.com`
    *   Password: `adminpassword`

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory** (from the project root):
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

### Backend

1.  Ensure your virtual environment in `backend/.venv` is activated.
2.  Navigate to the `backend/` directory.
3.  Start the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```
    The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` and ReDoc at `http://localhost:8000/redoc`.

### Frontend

1.  Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
2.  Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints Overview

The backend provides several API endpoints for managing users, patients, and authentication. Key endpoints include:

*   `POST /auth/token`: Obtain JWT token for login.
*   `POST /auth/register/`: Register new users.
    *   Admins can create users with `ADMIN` or `DOCTOR` roles.
    *   Doctors can create users with the `PATIENT` role.
*   `GET /users/me/`: Get current authenticated user's details.
*   `POST /patients/`: Create a patient profile (requires an existing user with `PATIENT` role, typically done by a Doctor or Admin after registering the patient user).
*   `GET /patients/`: List patient profiles (access controlled).
*   `GET /chat/`: (If fully implemented) Endpoints for chat functionality.

For a complete and interactive list of API endpoints, refer to the auto-generated documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the backend server is running.

API Versions:
- v0.1.2: Introduced new API for `database-v2`.
- v0.1.3: Added appointments API.
- v0.1.4: Added doctorAPI, hospitalsAPI and updated `crud.create_user` to insert records not only into the `users` table but also into the `patients` or `doctors` tables, as appropriate.
