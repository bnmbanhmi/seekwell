# SeekWell: AI-Powered Skin Disease Screening

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission
To provide accessible, early-stage skin disease screening for underserved communities. This tool empowers individuals in remote areas to perform a preliminary check using a smartphone, connects community health officials to at-risk cases, and streamlines the process for doctors to review and intervene.

## âœ¨ Core Features
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Users can upload a photo of a skin lesion and receive an instant AI-based risk assessment for six common types of skin conditions.
- **Targeted Dashboards**: Each user role (Patient, Official, Doctor, Admin) has a simple, focused interface showing only the information they need.
- **Urgent Case Alerts**: Officials and Doctors are automatically notified of high-risk cases, enabling rapid follow-up.
- **Patient Medical History**: All analyses are saved to a patient's private record, creating a timeline to track skin health.
